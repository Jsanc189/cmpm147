				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?</p>
				<p>This experiment I explored using noise to generate a terrain like one would see in a video game.</p>
				<p>In addition, I explored ways to dynamically place sprite tyles based on the output of noise.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?</p>
				<p>Initially, I just had a template that placed a random sprite tile from a set of tiles selected from a sprite sheet. This was done by creating a list of characters that represented a tile type that I wanted to place.</p>
				<p>From there, I then made a rectangle using these character traits to place different terrain types.  Afterwards, I utilized noise to assign characters to the list based on their values.  Lower values would have a water character, and higher terrain had ground or trees, etc.</p>
				<p>To create a more uniformed look, a lookup table was made.  This lookup table was a list of numbers pairs that corresponded to the sprite sheet.  Each character in the list, or 'tile', was looked at individually to check what type of neighboring tiles it had.  Based on this information, a 4 bit number was assigned to the tile.  This would then dictate the sprite that would spawn for that tile type.</p>
				<p>I then generated some clouds that would pass over the land.  This also utilized noise and the grid to spawn in circles with an offset.  The offset was to make sure the clouds didn't spawn over the same areas on the map.  I also attached the user's x and y values of their mouse to allow them to move the clouds.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</p>
				<p>I worked on this project alone.  I did share some of my work on our class discord to help when I had an answer to a question.  Most of my difficulty on this project was figuring out how to use noise to generate the terrain.</p>
				<p>The process itself took up a lot of time and there was a lot of trial and error to figure out how sprites should look, what colors look right, and how often something should happen in the terrain.</p>
				<p>I am really proud of the lookup tables and the layering I did.  Although it may seem obvious to others, I struggled a lot to think of ways to make the terrain look cohesive.  Overall, I am happy with my work.</p>
