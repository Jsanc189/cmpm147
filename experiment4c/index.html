				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?</p>
				<p>In the last part of experiment 4, I really just wanted to use the tools I learned in 4a and 4b to just mess around and see what happened.</p>
				<p>My main goal was to use layered noise and also add an element that wasn't visual to the piece.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?</p>
				<p>I decided to start fresh, but keep my layered noise function.  And then I colored each tile with color ranging from white to blue by using the noise height as the amount of space between 0 and 255 for each red and green values.  I started the range of blue values at 130.</p>
				<p>I just chose blue arbitrarily, but then I thought this looks like clouds, but it looked very grid-like.  I decided to instead of making a tile shaped like a rhomboid, to see what circles or spheres looked like.</p>
				<p>This was more interesting to me. I then thought about what if I make the circle diameter based on the noiseHeight value.  The Result was very cool looking.</p>
				<p>This resulted in a cool effect that made the circles pulse, almost to a beat. I then looked up an “ice blue” color to draw first.  With the added effect of the layered noise circles, this played some crazy tricks on my eyes. </p>
				<p>I then did a similar thing for 4a, and set up a color palette for the tiles.  I also updated it so that the world key will change colors for the background to match the color palettes of the circles.</p>
				<p>Next I decided to add a sound element for when the user clicks any cell.  I found a “pop” sound from https://www.myinstants.com/en/instant/pop-sfx-75405/.  I struggled a bit with what p5.js library to use. And I kept getting weird errors on the preload.  But after a bit of chatGPT questioning on how to fix it, I was able to get the right library.  However, the sounds played non-stop with one click because I set it to play on click inside the p3_drawTile function.  I forgot this function checks if a tile is clicked after each frame.  To fix this I placed the play sound inside the tileClicked function.  This then plays the sound only once when a tile is clicked.</p>
				<p>My next logical thought was how can I manipulate the sound using noise?  I did ask ChatGPT for some ideas and set out trying to make the popping sound different depending on the noise of the cell clicked. I figured I would try soundRate().  That turned out to be easy.  I simply just added a noise variable to check for the tile.  I then fed that variable into the .rate() of the sound and multiplied it by a random value between 0.1 and 1.  This just gives varying speeds to the sound's play rate.    Since this was so simple I decided to do the same with volume except I decided to divide it.  This varies the volume of the noise and allows for a fun effect of sound.</p>
				<p>And with that I decided I was happy with what I had made, especially given I was getting burned out on making three different types of art using noise and a tile map.</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</p>
				<p>The last part of this experiment was fun, as it was more of me just messing around with things I learned in the previous two steps.  I really like the popping sound and the variations I can make from it.</p>
				<p>I think difficulty-wise, by the time I got to the third part of this experiment, I was running low on energy.  I would have liked to have spent more time messing around to see what I could make with noise and maybe make another aspect that would integreate the layered noise.</p>
