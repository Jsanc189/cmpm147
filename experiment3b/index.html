				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?</p>
				<p>This experiment was an exploration into dungeon map making using similar logic to the terrain one in experimetn 3a.</p>
				<p>Here I looked more into randomizing tiles inside the dungeon, creating chests in that only spawned within a dungeon and also playing with color for ambiance.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?</p>
				<p>The logic is very similar to the logic in experiment 3a.  The main difference is that while generating the characters for the tile list I incorporated a random chance to place a chest character to be placed indead of a floor tile.</p>
				<p>The I also handled one off tiles that spaned for the dungeon differently in this map, and made them into decorations versus actual rooms to walk.</p>
				<p>To create more of a mood, I darkened the whole screen with a semi- transparent rectangle that covers the entire canvas.  I then used a p5.js build in function called overlay that would "take out" the opposite color of the type I was using.</p>
				<p>In this case I used a while circle that followed the user's mouse.  I then used the blend function built into p5.js that blended the colors to then allow more of the bottom layers of the image to come through.  This made the piece looke like you are shining a small light wherever the user mouse is placed on the canvas.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</p>
				<p>This piece felt a little easier to make, given I already had the same noise function I was using in the previous experiment.  It felt more fun to play with other things like blending colors and creating odd circumstances to make certain sprites spawn.</p>
				<p>Honestly, most of my challenge this time was trying to figure out how to integrate both the map and the ascii representation of the map into this webpage for experiment 3a and 3b.</p>
